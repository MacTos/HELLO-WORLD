# HELLO-WORLD
getting stared with github... and the start of my coding computer evolution
The world I/WE live in is almost completly run, surrounded and controlled by computers and technology.. and the language that is being spoken it CODE... bianary.  so i need/want to know what everyone is talking about. my love of science/tech, and beliefe that EVERYTHING is math, it makes sense to me that learning code and all the comes along with cs, the internet and programming,hacking,and all the jazz...
How should i go about starting from the bottom to head to the top?
wheres the bottom ? where to start? and what direction do i head?
